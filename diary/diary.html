      <h2>I have something to tell you...</h2>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
      Today I spent some time reflecting my feelings about someone‚Äîyou. It's something I've never done before. So, please bare with me if it doesn't read well. 
      </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
      I don't remember when the last time someone had my heart beating fast and had me smiling driving home. Somehow you
      were just being you and that has stolen my heart completely. 
      </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">It was only a brief moment we got to know each other and spent time together. It may feel like
      a "falling-for-a-stranger" kinda feeling. I tried my best to avoid that type of feeling, so that I don't fall for
      someone just because of their beauty.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">It may be art that makes you
      stand out, or the effort you put in your outfits that compliments the beauty you already have, or the little small
      braids you did with your hair that make your hair look nice. But the more I got to know you, the more my feeling
      grow. It's the way you laughed, the way you tried to tease me, the way you said you appricate things someone did,
      or even the way you negociated with shop owners. These small little things tell me that you are just an art
      yourself and I enjoyed seeing you doing all that. It felt like you just came out of songs I listened to. So, I
      really apologise for taking so long to eventualy express my feelings‚Äîbut I can
      tell you that it wasn't just a "falling-for-a-stranger" feeling. I did fall for you. I'm glad we met. Also, I am
      happy you kissed me, and still smiling thinking about it now. It was very
      brief, but these memories will stay with me for a long long time I'm certain. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
      You have just raised the bar so high,
      not sure if anyone would ever reach that. Well... it sucks to be them I guess hahaha</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">I hate working in astronomy that I can't really comprehence     how big the universe is, but I can feel how far the distance between you and me since you left. I don't really know when I'll see you again (life's somehow unfair), but I want you
      to keep being you. And one day if you find someone, I hope he treats you right as you deserve it. If anyone would
      ever do wrong to you, I will hunt them down (even when I'm a ghost üëª). And when you ever feel
      down, I hope you know that once you made me very happy because you exist. I hope you get time to do art and other
      things you love to do, don't ever doubt yourself :)</p>
      <p style="text-indet: 15px;"> Goodluck with everything you do. I will be here admiring you.</p>
      <p style="text-indet: 15px;"> I hate working in astronomy somehow. I can't really comprehence how big the universe
      is, but I can feel how far the distance between you and me since you left.</p>
