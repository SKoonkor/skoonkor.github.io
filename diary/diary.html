      <h2>I have something to tell you...</h2>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
      Dear Humaira... </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
      Today I spent some time reflecting on my feelings about someone‚Äîyou. It's something I've never done before, so please bare with me if it doesn't read well. 
      </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
      I don't remember when the last time someone had my heart beating fast and had me smiling while driving home. Somehow you
      were just being you, and that has completely stolen my heart. 
      </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">It was only a brief moment we got to know each other and spent time together. It may feel like
      a "falling-for-a-stranger" kinda feeling. I tried my best to avoid that, so I wouldn't fall for
      someone just because of their beauty.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">It may be your art that makes you
      stand out, or the effort you put into your outfits that compliments the beauty you already have, or the little small
      braids you did with your hair that make it look lovely. But the more I got to know you, the more my feeling
      grew. It's the way you laughed, the way you teased me, the way you appricated things others did for you,
      or even the way you negociated with shop owners. These small little things tell me that <it>you are art
      yourself</it>, and I loved seeing you doing all that. It felt like you came straight out of songs I listened to‚Äîyou made
      the lyrics feel real. You felt like someone I've dreamt of meeting, someone I have a deep desire of doing good things
      for. So, I really apologise for taking so long to finally express my feelings‚Äîbut I can
      tell you that it wasn't just a "falling-for-a-stranger" feeling. I truly did fall for you. I'm glad we met. Also, I am
      happy you kissed me‚ÄîI still smile thinking about it now. It was
      brief, but those memories will stay with me for a long long time, I'm certain. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
      You have just raised the bar so high,
      I'm not sure anyone will ever reach. Well... it sucks to be them I guess hahaha</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Despite working in astronomy, yet I can't really comprehend
      how big the universe is, but the feeling of distance since you left feels even greater. I don't really know when I'll see you again (life's somehow unfair), but I want you
      to keep being you. And one day, if you find someone, I hope he treats you right as you deserve. If anyone would
      ever wrong you, I will hunt them down (even when I'm a ghost üëª). And when you ever feel
      down, I hope you remember that once, you made me very happy‚Äîsimply because you exist. I hope you get time for art
      and all the things you love. Don't ever doubt yourself :)</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;"> Goodluck with everything you do. I will be here, admiring you‚Äîalways.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;"> Sutti x</p>
